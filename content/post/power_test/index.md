In the [coursebook of my Master seminar concerning *Latent Variables in Political Communication*](https://bookdown.org/luenich/Latente_Variablen/), I recently added an important chapter that includes a tutorial of how to perform a power test for estimating sample size for hypothesis testing mean differences of a latent factor model with two groups.

The chapter can be accessed via the following link: [https://bookdown.org/luenich/Latente_Variablen/power-test-for-mean-differences-between-two-samples.html](https://bookdown.org/luenich/Latente_Variablen/power-test-for-mean-differences-between-two-samples.html)
